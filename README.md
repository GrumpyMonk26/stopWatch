# Stopwatch

### Vanilla JavaScript Project

#### Project description

##### Welcome to the Stopwatch Project! Our goal is to create a user-friendly timer with intuitive controls. At the top of the page, you will find a timer display, accompanied by three buttons: start, stop, and reset.

##### To initiate the timer, simply click the "START" button. The timer will begin counting from zero, utilizing a JavaScript method called SetInterval. If you need to pause the timer at any point, the "STOP" button will come in handy. It utilizes the clearInterval function to temporarily halt the timer.

##### In case you wish to reset the timer back to zero, the "RESET" button is at your disposal. Clicking this button will effectively clear the timer's current progress. Moreover, if you previously paused the timer using the "STOP" button and then decide to resume it by clicking "START" again, the timer will continue from where it left off, incorporating the elapsed time.

##### To enhance the visual appeal and interactivity, we will start by implementing CSS styles for the buttons, including design elements and hover effects. Then, using JavaScript, we will retrieve the current time from the browser, manipulate the content accordingly, replace it with the calculated time, and provide seamless functionality for starting, stopping, and resetting the timer.
